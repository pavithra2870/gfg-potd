# Find the peak element in a 2d matrix

- peak element is elemet greater than the element on 4 directions next to it
- brute force is m*n so we use binary search on columns because we can return any peak element
- we choose to use the mid column, find the row which has the max element of the column 
- if the max element of the column is greater than elements on left and right (because max element of a column is obv greater than elements up and down), it is the peak
- if the left element is greater than the max element, peak prolly lies on the left so h=mid-1
- if right is greater than max element, peak is on right so l=mid+1

class Solution:
    def findPeakGrid(self, mat):
        m,n=len(mat),len(mat[0])
        l,h=0,n-1
        while l<=h:
            mid=(l+h)//2
            maxRow,e=0,mat[0][mid]
            for i in range(1,m):
                if mat[i][mid]>e: maxRow,e=i,mat[i][mid]
            left=mat[maxRow][mid-1] if mid-1>=0 else float("-inf")
            right=mat[maxRow][mid+1] if mid+1<n else float("-inf")
            if e>=left and e>=right: return [maxRow,mid]
            if left>e: h=mid-1
            else: l=mid+1
